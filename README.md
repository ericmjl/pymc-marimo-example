# PyMC Marimo Example

> [!CAUTION]
>
> This example is still a work in progress. 

This is duplicate of the PyMC README example but using Marimo to run the notebook. Check out the original example [here](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc?tab=readme-ov-file#linear-regression-example).

This example uses [`nutpie`](https://github.com/pymc-devs/nutpie) which is a fast NUTS sampler written in Rust.

## Run this example in Marimo:

Run the example yourself with the following command:

```terminal
uvx marimo edit https://github.com/williambdean/pymc-marimo-example/blob/main/readme-example.py
```
